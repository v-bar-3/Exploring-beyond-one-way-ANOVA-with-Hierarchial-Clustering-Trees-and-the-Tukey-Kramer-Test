# Exploring beyond one way ANOVA with Hierarchial Clustering Trees and the Tukey KramerTest
Project 2 for STAT 106: Analysis of Variance

This project utilizes the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset

Project Guidelines and Prompt:
Divide the entire data set into 32(= K ) samples with respect to 5 binary variables of your choices, for instance, HD, Sex, Stroke, Blood-pressure, Cholesterol. Compare the 32 BMI distributions.
Perform the one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer’s simultaneous pairwise comparison as if all Normality and equal-variance assumptions hold. Check whether the equal variance assumption is violated? That is, members of {σ21 , σ22 , .., σ2K } are not all equal.
Check whether the Normality assumption is violated?
Construct HC-tree to discover the community structures among the K samples?
Compare results from ANOVA and and Tukey-Kramer’s comparison with results found in HC-tree.
